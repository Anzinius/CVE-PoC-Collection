# CVE PoC Collection üìöüõ°Ô∏è

## Overview üåê
Welcome to the **CVE PoC Collection** repository! This repository is a collection of CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) along with their corresponding Proof of Concept (PoC) exploit codes, Snort rules, and technical explanations. Each CVE is documented in its own directory, providing a comprehensive resource for security researchers and developers interested in vulnerability analysis.

## Repository Structure üóÇÔ∏è
Each CVE vulnerability is organized in its own folder following the structure below:
```
CVE-PoC-Collection/
‚îÇ
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ CVE-XXXX-YYYY/
‚îÇ ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md
‚îÇ ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ poc_code.py
‚îÇ ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ exploit_code.py
‚îÇ ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ snort_rules/
‚îÇ 	‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ CVE-XXXX-YYYY.rules
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ CVE-XXXX-ZZZZ/
‚îÇ ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md
‚îÇ ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ poc_code.py
‚îÇ ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ exploit_code.py
‚îÇ ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ snort_rules/
‚îÇ 	‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ CVE-XXXX-ZZZZ.rules
‚îÇ
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ...
```


### Contents of Each Folder:
- **README.md**: Contains details about the specific CVE, including a technical description, severity level, affected software, and links to external resources.
- **poc_code.py**: Proof of Concept code demonstrating how the vulnerability can be exploited.
- **exploit_code.py**: Exploit code that demonstrates leveraging the CVE in a real-world scenario.
- **snort_rules/**: Contains Snort rules for detecting the vulnerability.

## How to Use üöÄ
To explore a specific CVE, navigate to the corresponding folder and review the README file for details. The PoC and exploit code can be used for testing and security research purposes, and Snort rules can be integrated into your intrusion detection system to detect attacks related to the vulnerability.

### Example Usage:
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/anzinius/CVE-PoC-Collection.git
    ```

2. Navigate to a specific CVE folder:
    ```bash
    cd CVE-PoC-Collection/CVE-XXXX-YYYY/
    ```

3. Run the PoC or exploit code as per the instructions provided in the README of that folder.

## Snort Rules üõ†Ô∏è
This repository includes custom Snort rules to detect the exploitation of various CVEs. These rules can be found in the `snort_rules/` folder inside each CVE directory. You can integrate them into your Snort setup for real-time monitoring and detection.

### Example Snort Rule:
```plaintext
alert tcp any any -> any any (msg:"CVE-XXXX-YYYY Detected"; sid:1000001; rev:1;)
```
